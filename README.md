# Spencer Cloud's Icon

This is an icon that I created to use across my various projects where I don't have the time and/or current need to create an icon for that specific project. The symbolism should be obvious.

This is particularly made for favicons, to eliminate an browser potentially complaining about a missing `favicon.ico` file, but may be used for anything where appropriate.

This is _not_ on an open license. If you would like to use this, you must get my permission.

## Improvements

- [ ] Create a version that is an outline as one (or two) paths for better fill control
    - In the current version, filling the main `svg` element leads to awkward fill patterns
- [ ] Add light/dark versioning
- [ ] Add version compatible with animations / figure out a cool way to animate this
